> If you're here, you're probably looking for [Karata.Web](https://karatagame.herokuapp.com), the modern version built on [.NET 6](https://get.dot.net/6). Unfortunately, that version is closed-source. This is only an early version that ran as a console application.

# Karata.Console
[WIP] The card game we all know and love.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to publish the application and runtime into a self-contained package.

### Pre-requisites

1. Git
2. [.NET Core 3.1.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the repo to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/sixpeteunder/karata
```

Enter the project directory:

```
cd karata
```

Run the app:

```
dotnet run
```

Development environment is set up!

Follow the prompts to play the game.

## Deployment

To build an executable binary for your platform, run:

```
dotnet publish -r <RID>
```

I will update this with notes on how to create a self-contained installer for the app.

Replace `<RID>` with the [specific Runtime Identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) for your platform.
